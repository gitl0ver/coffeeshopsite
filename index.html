      <p> Welcome to <b>Jeff's Coffee</b>! We specialize in all kinds of delicious coffee-centric drinks, treats and sweets. Check out our menu or contact us for more information about our services and hiring opportunities! We are an equal-opportunity employer and are always looking to add new members to our team. Okay, but really, I hope you enjoy my website. I don't really know what else to put here, but I wanted to make it look long, like a real website. This site is dedicated to my buddy Jeff who inspired me to go above and beyond with the appearance of it, resulting in me learning a lot about decorating things in CSS. I wanted to make sure to meet the requirements of the assignment regarding what we learned in Chapter 2 while also making sure the website looked classy (or at least I tried!)
        </br>
        </br>We are located at <b>2411 Coffee Shop Street, Atlanta, GA 30301</b>.
