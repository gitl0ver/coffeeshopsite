    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <info>
      <p>Jeff's Coffee was founded in 2019 off of one brilliant idea: What if coffee could be really expensive, and make me millions of dollars? Well, since we're not a real coffee shop, I don't really know what to put here, but I hope you enjoy the way I presented it because I enjoyed making it, although it might be a little spaghetti-like, so I apologize for that, but I hope the comments are sufficient for seeing and grading my work. <b>- David Rosa</b></p>
