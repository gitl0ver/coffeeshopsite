      <!--An example of lists (and nested HTML tags!)-->
      <ul>
        <li><b>Black Coffee - $3.95</b>
        <ul>
        The classic wake-up call. A simple black coffee. We wouldn't judge you for adding sugar or sweeteners.
        </ul>
        <li><b>Latte - $5.95</b>
        <ul>
        Our most popular. An espresso with steamed milk. Available in hot or iced and come in multiple flavors (listed at the bottom of the page).
        </ul>
        <li><b>Frappe - $6.95</b>
        <ul>
        A style of iced coffee that came all the way from Greece.
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cappucino - $6.95</b>
        <ul>
        Espresso served with layers of steamed and foamed milk.
        </ul>
        <li><b>Cappe - $7.95</b>
        <ul>
        It's like a Frappucino, but Starbucks would sue us if we called it that, so...come in get your coffee and don't tell anyone!
        </ul>
        <li><b>Jeff's Special - $25.00</b>
        <ul>
        Jeff's special is COMPLETELY unpredictable. Depends on how he's feeling that day. Coffee? Soup? Salad? Nothing? Well...who knows.
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Daniel's Greatest Dish - $200.00</b>
        <ul>
        Daniel makes the greatest dishes, but we won't tell you what they are until you pay us $200 to find out. But we can assure you, they are great. Maybe even the greatest.
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Dave's Milk n' Cookies - $15.00</b>
        <ul>
        Settle down with some of Dave's famous milk and cookies, baked fresh daily. Unless he's feeling really down because Jeff and Daniel made fun of his cookie-baking habits.
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Syrup Flavors</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Cararmel</li>
          <li>Vanilla</li>
          <li>Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li>White Chocolate</li>
          <li>Strawberry</li>
          <li>Banana</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
