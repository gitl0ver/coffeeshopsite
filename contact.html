    <info>
      <p>Since we are a nonexistant coffee shop, we don't have any contact information (other than my school e-mail ðŸ˜Ž) and this is about all there is, I just put this page here so that the website wouldn't feel so empty.</p>
      <!--Use of inline font styling below, font, colors :)-->
      <p style ="font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:green">
        Actually, I changed my mind while writing this, this is a great opportunity for me to use inline styling since I realized I didn't use much in the main pages.
